**If you are here because you want to jumpstart your own Vue + Django project using these methods, then check out the [Django Vue Cookiecutter](https://github.com/ilikerobots/cookiecutter-vue-django) instead**.  The cookiecutter project is more flexible, has more options, has better demonstrations of Vue + Django, and is intended for production deployment.

This companion application illustrates the fusion of Django and Vue, allowing combined use of both without compromising the strengths and full power of either.

Specifically, the application features:
  * Vue Single File Components (SFCs)
  * Vuex support with preserved state across components and page loads
  * Hot Reloading of Vue components
  * Configurable bundling of Vue JS/CSS resources
  * Support for deferred loading of some or all Vue resources
  * Standard use of Django templating where desired
